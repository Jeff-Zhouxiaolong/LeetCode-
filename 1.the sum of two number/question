给定一个整数数列，找出其中和为特定值的那两个数。

你可以假设每个输入都只会有一种答案，同样的元素不能被重用。

示例:

给定 nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9

因为 nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
所以返回 [0, 1]



Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
Output: index1=1, index2=2
